    Each IPv6 segment is any hexadecimal value between
    0 and ffff.

    Each segment is one to four hexadecimal digits.

    == OUTPUT ==

    Leading zeros MUST be suppressed.  For example, 2001:0db8::0001 is
    not acceptable and must be represented as 2001:db8::1.  A single 16-
    bit 0000 field MUST be represented as 0.

    The characters "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", and "f" in an IPv6 address
    MUST be represented in lowercase.
